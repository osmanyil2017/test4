To push all your branches, use either (replace REMOTE with the name of the remote, for example "origin"):

git push REMOTE '*:*'
git push REMOTE --all
To push all your tags:

git push REMOTE --tags
Finally, I think you can do this all in one command with:

git push REMOTE --mirror
However, in addition --mirror, will also push your remotes, so this might not be exactly what you want.
